# Variance-Analysis
The main goal was to understand how budget and actual tables can describe any businessâ€™s performance and apply that on a given dataset.

Key Outcomes & Insights

ðŸ”¹ Overall variance was -0.42%, meaning actual performance was close to budget.

ðŸ”¹Carlota (+0.48%) and Quad (+0.12%) performed well, but Aspen (-1.56%) contributed most to the shortfall.

ðŸ”¹ The 4th Qtr. showed significant swings. This hints at year-end pressures or seasonal trends impacting budgeting accuracy.

New Techniques I Applied:

ðŸ”¹Change the Actual Revenue from daily basis to monthly based to fit the budget and make the analysis more accurate using the DAX function "DATESBETWEEN". 

ðŸ”¹I started learning about bookmarks and practiced it by making a switch button that switches visuals (In this dashboard, it switches line to ribbon and vice versa).

ðŸ”¹Practiced the KPI card enhancement by modifying the single card format by:

Implementing a title and subtitle: the subtitle (contains the metrics) was generated using a DAX function that formats the measures to text.

Creating the callout value using a DAX function that combines multiple measures for an optimized view.
